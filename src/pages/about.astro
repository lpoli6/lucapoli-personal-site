      <p>
        I am an AI and enterprise technology executive focused on one question: how do you take AI from boardroom
        slides to production systems that actually work?
      </p>

      <p>
        My work sits between technical capability and operational reality. Strategy only matters when it survives
        budgets, incentives, timelines, and legacy systems, then turns into execution people trust.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Palantir, I led deployments across EMEA, APAC, and the US, with work spanning Zambia, South Korea, and the
        United States. I delivered large-scale rollouts, including a 50,000+ user deployment at Airbus and a 20,000+
        user transformation in industrial manufacturing. I built with operators on the ground and focused on systems
        teams could use every day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today I am Executive Director, AI Business Transformation at CBRE. I lead AI business transformation across
        CBRE's full portfolio of business units, with a specific focus on property management, and I also advise
        independently on AI strategy globally at CBRE. We ship production-scale applications that teams use in real
        operations, not a continuous stream of proofs of concept.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am originally from Solarolo Monasterolo, a small town of 80 people on the river Po in northern Italy, and I
        am now based between London and Miami.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I am not working, I train for triathlons, run ultramarathons, and swim in open water. Endurance sport
        teaches me patience, discipline, and how to stay calm when it gets hard. I value craft, determination, and
        clear thinking under pressure, both in business and in life.
