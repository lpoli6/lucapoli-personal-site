        I am an AI and enterprise technology executive focused on one question: how do you make ambitious technology
        transformations actually stick inside large organisations? My work sits in the space between technical
        capability and operational reality, where strategy has to survive contact with budgets, incentives, systems,
        and people.

        At Palantir, as a Forward Deployed Engineer, I worked directly with operators in aerospace and manufacturing. I
        helped deliver large-scale deployments, including a 50,000+ user rollout at Airbus and a 20,000+ user
        transformation in industrial manufacturing. That chapter taught me that enterprise impact is rarely about the
        model alone; it is about data quality, workflow design, and relentless execution around adoption.

        Today I am Executive Director of AI Business Transformation at CBRE, leading Project Core / Athena, a $6M+
        multi-year programme. We are building internal AI capability, including the Ellis platform, and driving a
        141-FTE transformation across property management and finance operations. For me, transformation means building
        systems, teams, and change management muscle that can compound year after year, not one-off pilots. I also
        advise independently on enterprise AI strategy and explore early-stage opportunities in PropTech.

        I am Italian, from Cremona, and based between London and Miami. Outside work I train seriously for triathlons,
        ultras, and open-water swimming. I value craft, endurance, and clear thinking under pressure, in both business
        and life.
