For most of my career, I measured my value by how quickly I could turn ambiguity into working systems.

As an engineer, especially in forward-deployed work, that reflex is useful. You parachute into a messy environment, talk to operators, map constraints, build fast, and iterate until something works under real conditions. There is a direct line between your effort and output. You write code, a workflow changes, a team gets a result.

Moving into executive leadership broke that feedback loop.

I still care deeply about technical quality, but my job now is less about building the solution myself and more about shaping the conditions where many teams can build and operate well. That sounds obvious when you say it out loud. It feels very different in practice.

The first big shift was time horizon. Engineering rewards short-cycle problem solving. Executive work demands longer arcs: capability plans, budget cycles, hiring, operating models, governance, and stakeholder alignment that may take quarters to mature. I had to get comfortable with decisions whose payoff was distant and uncertain.

The second shift was leverage. As an engineer, my leverage came from direct contribution. As an executive, my leverage comes from clarity: setting priorities, allocating resources, removing blockers, and creating accountability. On good days, I help ten people move faster. On bad days, I create ambiguity that slows everyone down. The blast radius is larger either way.

The third shift was identity. I had to let go of the idea that being the most technical person in the room was the point. It is not. The point is getting the right outcome for the business while keeping technical integrity intact. Sometimes that means saying no to elegant solutions that are operationally brittle. Sometimes it means defending slower, foundational work when others want immediate optics.

At CBRE, where I lead AI business transformation, this tension is constant. There is real ambition and real pressure for visible progress. My old instinct is still to jump into implementation details. Sometimes I do, but if I stay there too long, I am solving the wrong problem. The bigger problem is whether the organisation can repeatedly deploy, govern, and scale AI across functions with different incentives and maturity levels.

I also underestimated the emotional side of the transition. Engineering gives you frequent proof of competence. Executive work often does not. You spend more time in tradeoffs than in wins. You make decisions with incomplete information. You carry risk on behalf of the organisation. You need thicker skin and better judgment, not just better tactics.

What helped me most was keeping a few principles:

- Stay close to reality. Talk directly to operators and delivery teams, not only to leadership layers.
- Translate relentlessly. Good strategy dies if finance, operations, product, and engineering hear different stories.
- Protect standards. Speed without rigor creates expensive debt.
- Build people, not dependency. If everything still routes through you, you have not scaled.

I do miss parts of hands-on engineering: the craft, the flow, the concrete progress by end of day. But I do not see this as leaving engineering behind. I see it as applying the same discipline at a different altitude.

The question is no longer "Can I build this?" It is "Can we build this repeatedly, responsibly, and at scale?" That is a harder question, and a more interesting one.
